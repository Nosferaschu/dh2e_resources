The control interface allows the Acolyte to zoom and highlight parts of the holographic display, and turning on the spot causes the recorder above to turn, allowing the Acolyte to survey the area around him in great detail, which grants a +20 bonus to Navigate (Surface), Survival (Tracking), and Scrutiny tests.

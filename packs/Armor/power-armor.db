Many suits are heirloom items hundreds&mdash;or even thousands&mdash;of years old. They come in a variety of styles, from lighter suits befitting elite Acolytes to heavy versions designed for intense fighting. The huge and ancient versions of the Adeptus Astartes are a separate class of power armour, using special implants to link the armour to the user in a manner no human could wear or operate. Light power armour requires a constant power supply, normally built into the suit, which offsets its weight so it does not count against the user&rsquo;s normal carrying limit (see page 248). It grants the user the Unnatural Strength (1) trait and increases the value of his Size trait by 1 level. Unless stated otherwise, the power supply functions for 1d5 hours before needing recharging or refuelling. Most suits feature a detachable helmet; when this in place, the wearer benefits from an internal oxygen supply and standard vox systems.</p>","availability":"very-rare","weight":40,"type":"power","part":{"head":7,"leftArm":7,"rightArm":7,"body":7,"leftLeg":7,"rightLeg":7},"maxAgility":40},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dh2e_Resources/icons/Armor/spiked-shoulder-armor.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ELPBBNNFVnIUGZXc"}

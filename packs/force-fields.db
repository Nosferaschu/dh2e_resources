They operate not by absorbing or shunting away an attack&rsquo;s energy, but instead by shifting the user away using miniature Warp-jump technologies. This jump is normally triggered through sensors located with the device, though it can also be activated manually if desired. Each activation carries the supreme risk of unprotected travel through the Empyrean; even as the body is swept to safety, the soul risks damnation. When the field successfully nullifies an attack, the user jumps in a random direction using the Scatter Diagram on page 230. Roll 3d10 for the number of metres travelled&mdash;the wearer always emerges on solid footing and in a suitable empty space. If all three dice come up with the same number (e.g., 3 results of 7), then the user does not re-emerge for 1d5 rounds and gains 1 Corruption point from exposure to the unnatural energies within the Warp. If the activation is unexpected, then the wearer cannot act for one round while he regains his sense of place.&nbsp;</p>","availability":"near-unique","weight":2,"protectionRating":55,"overloadChance":10},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"w0GSzSDyYaU7OUCJ"}

Activating or deactivating a generator requires a Full Action, which also activates all other linked generators.

The barrier acts as cover, so only parts of the body protected by the ield wall gain force ield protection.
